OK. Here is what we need to do:

* Create this as a typical plugin to the cruise application overall. 
* Monkey patch the Project class to load any cruise plugins

* symlink to my cruisecontrol 1.3 directory

* There are two parts, the plugin itself and the builder plugin. 

The plugin itself provides the following functionality:
  * Bootstap code for the templates and views, any other monkey patches

We should also make a directive for a project which is going to incorporate the monkey patching.
